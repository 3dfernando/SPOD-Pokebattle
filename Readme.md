Thanks for downloading this Pokemon Essentials mod! I made this mod with RPG Maker XP to create a battle between the grad
student's brain and the PIV data set to be analyzed for the Spectral POD video I made (https://youtu.be/OhyksL-1vew)

If you want to run the game, run the Game.exe file in the Lab [Release] folder. If you have RPG maker XP, you can edit
the game. Most of the other maps from original Pokemon FireRed are still there! I needed to hack into the game engine to get
the scenes to behave the way I wanted them to, though.

Reviewing the stats, you'll see the move Spectral POD that Brain uses is incredibly powerful, with a 600 base power.
That was done for the story; as the SPOD will always finish off the data set!

I hope you have fun exploring the mod!
